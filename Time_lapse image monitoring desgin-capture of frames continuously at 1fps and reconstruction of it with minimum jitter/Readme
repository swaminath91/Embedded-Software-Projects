The hough_snap_test.cpp is the source code file, which is run on a embedded linux platform, that uses OpenCV libraries to make a continuous capture of frames of data in .ppm format
The frames are captured continuously at 1 frame per second using systick clock timer with the help of appropriate sleep delay.
The captured frames are timestamped along with the header information. 
The captured frames are reconstructed using H264 mpeg codec into a timelapse reconstructed video to show that capture is made at exact frame rate and all the frames meet the deadlines and avoid latency and jitter
There's text file named cap2000.txt which shows the timestamp information when the executable was ran on a Linux terminal.
By measuring the average frame rate along with the captured times of alternate frames, we can calculate the jitter.
This source code file, only makes the camera capture and store the frames in ppm format with timestamp embedded on each frame of image. Reconstruction of the video doesn't need a driver program and can be done on the Linux terminal by using FFMPEG commands.
I have attached some sample frames of capture(snapshot_ .ppm) using this cpp source code file.
