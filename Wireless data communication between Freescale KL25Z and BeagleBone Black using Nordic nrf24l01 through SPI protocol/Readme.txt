This folder has 3 files

1. General_project has SPI and nordic drivers along with TX and RX interrupt handlers for all modules

2. DMA_KL25Z_SPI1_SPI0 is an extra work where I try to use dma with spi to control one component as master and other as slave
3. Third is the beaglebone SPI driver for configuring Beaglebone to communicate with nordic chip
